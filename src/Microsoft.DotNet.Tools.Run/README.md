dotnet-run
===========

# NAME 
dotnet-run -- Runs source code 'in-place' without any explicit compile or launch commands.

# SYNOPSIS
dotnet run [options]

# DESCRIPTION
The run command provides a convenient option to run source code with one command. It compiles source code, generates an output program and then runs that program. This command is useful for fast iterative development and can also be used to run a source-distributed program (e.g. website).

This command relies on the [compile command](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/48) to compile source inputs to a .NET assembly, before launching the program. The requirements for and handling of source inputs for this command are all inhereted from the compile command. The documentation for the compile command provides more information on those requirements.

Output files, are written to the child `bin` folder, which will be created if it doesn't exist. Files will be overwritten as needed. Temporary files are written to the child `obj` folder.  

# Options

-v, --verbose
Prints verbose logging information, to follow the flow of execution of the command.
